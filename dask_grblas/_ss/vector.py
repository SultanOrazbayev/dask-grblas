        Extract a diagonal from a Matrix or TransposedMatrix into a Vector.
        Existing entries in the Vector are discarded.

        Parameters
        ----------
        matrix : Matrix or TransposedMatrix
            Extract a diagonal from this matrix.
        k : int, default 0
            Diagonal in question.  Use `k>0` for diagonals above the main diagonal,
            and `k<0` for diagonals below the main diagonal.
